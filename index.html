<h2 id="ab">What is COVID-19?</h2>
<p style="font-size:100%" id="p1">Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.<br>
Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.[6] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.[7] They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.<br>
5] Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[25] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.<br>
COVID-19 mainly spreads through the air when people are near each other,[a] primarily via small droplets or aerosols, as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. Transmission via contaminated surfaces has not been conclusively demonstrated, and the main mode of transmission is suspected to be airborne.[19] It can spread from an infected person for up to two days before symptoms appear (presymptomatic), and from those who do not show any (asymptomatic). People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases. The standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.<br>
Preventive measures include social distancing, quarantine, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.</p>

<h2 id="vac">Vaccine </h2>
<p style="background-color:yellow;font-size:100%" id="p2">Previous work to develop a vaccine against SARS and MERS established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses – which accelerated development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID‑19 vaccine.[372] As of October 2020, there were 321 vaccine candidates in development, a 2.5 fold increase since April. However, no candidate has completed vaccine trials to prove its safety and efficacy.[373] In October, some 44 vaccine candidates were in clinical research: namely 34 in Phase I–II trials and 10 in Phase II–III trials.<br>
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) scientists reported in September 2020, that nine different technology platforms  – with the technology of numerous candidates remaining undefined  – were under research and development during 2020, to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19.[373] According to CEPI, most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials as of September are focused on the coronavirus spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection.[373] Platforms being developed in 2020, involve nucleic acid technologies (RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.</p>
